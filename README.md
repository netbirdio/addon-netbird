## About

NetBird is a simple and fast alternative to corporate VPNs built on top of WireGuard® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

NetBird can connect machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.

It requires near zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.
