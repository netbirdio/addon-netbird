## About

[NetBird](https://netbird.io/)® is a simple and fast alternative to corporate VPNs built on top of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

[NetBird](https://netbird.io/)® can connect machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.

It requires near-zero configuration effort, leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.
